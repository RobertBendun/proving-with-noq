double :: X + X = 2*X
exponents_sum :: X^(A + B) = X^A*X^B
mult_assoc :: (A*B)*C = A*(B*C)
mult_comm :: X*Y = Y*X
mult_id :: X*1 = X
mult_zero :: 0*X = 0
refl :: X == X = true

We claim that the only linear map from polynomials to polynomials named `d`
that has these two properties:
[source]
----
derivative_constant :: d(X) = 1
derivative_mult :: d(X*Y) = d(X)*Y + X*d(Y)
----
is derivative.

Since we are talking about polynomials we need only power rule (other properties are covered by linear map claim):

[source]
----
derivative_power_rule :: d(X^N) = N*X^(N - 1)
----

We will prove power rule using induction.
We construct induction hypothesis:

derivative_power_rule_hyp :: d(X^n) = n*X^(n - 1)

== Base case

derivative_power_rule_base :: d(X^0) == 0*d(X) {
    mult_zero | 0
    X^0 = 1 | 0
    X == Y = and(X == X, X == Y) | 0
    1 = 1*1 | 1
    derivative_mult | 0
    mult_comm | 1
    double | 0
    mult_id | 0
    X == 2*X = X == 0 | 0
    and(A == B, A == C) = B == C | 0
    refl | 0
}

== Inductive case

[source]

derivative_power_rule_ind :: d(X^(n + 1)) == (n + 1)*X^n {
    exponents_sum | 0
    derivative_mult | 0
    X^1 = X | all
    derivative_constant | 1
    derivative_power_rule_hyp | 0
    mult_assoc | 0
    X = X^1 | 10
    exponents_sum |! 0
    (X - A) + A = X | 0
    mult_id | 0
    N*X + X = (N + 1)*X | 0
    refl | 0
